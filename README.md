# Marram_nematodes
This script and data set are used to run the (JSDM) analysis in the paper 'The functional composition of dune nematode communities is structured by both biogeographic region and the local marram grass environment' by Van De Walle et al., 2023, EJSB (in progress).

**Explanation of the columns of the data set:**  
country: the country where the samples were taken. BE = Belgium, FR = France, NL = the Netherlands, UK = the United Kingdom.  
Site: the number of the sampled site. Numbers start from 0 for all different countries.  
Bact_S: The number of bactivorous nematodes found in one gram of soil/sand.  
Fung_S: The number of fungivorous nematodes found in one gram of soil/sand.  
Plant_S: The number of plant-feeding nematodes found in one gram of soil/sand.  
Omn_S:	 The number of omnivorous nematodes found in one gram of soil/sand.  
Pred_S:	The number of predatory nematodes found in one gram of soil/sand.  
Unk_S: The number of unidentifiable nematodes found in one gram of soil/sand.  
Total_S: The total number of nematodes found in one gram of soil/sand.  
Bact_R: The number of bactivorous nematodes found in one gram roots.  
Fung_R: The number of fungivorous nematodes found in one gram roots.  
Plant_R: The number of plant-feeding nematodes found in one gram roots.  
Omn_R: The number of omnivorous nematodes found in one gram roots.  
Pred_R: The number of predatory nematodes found in one gram of roots.  
Unk_R: The number of unidentifiable nematodes found in one gram of roots.  
Total_R: The total number of nematodes found in one gram roots.  
M10: Moranâ€™s I of the surrounding marram grass, calculated in a circle defined by the central marram grass tussock and a 10m radius.  
P10: The proportion of marram grass present in a circle defined by the central marram grass tussock and a 10m radius.  
Transect: The code of the dune are where the sample was taken.  
Vitality: A vitality measure; scored 0-4 with 0 being all dead leaves.  
District: The biogeographic region the sample was designated to.  
X: the x-coordinate of the sample.  
Y: the y-coordinate of the sample.  
sample_ID: The unique sample ID; consisting of the site number in combination with the country.  
senecio: Presence/absence data for Senecio inaequidens in a 5m radius around the central marram grass tussock.
